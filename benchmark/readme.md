Benchmark Instances
=================== 

There are three benchmarks: argumentation, positional games and strips
planning, each in the respective folder. 

Each of the three benchmarks contains a model file and a folder for instances. 
They can be compiled via Bule with 

```
bule <model> <instance> --output qdimacs
```

The results can be found in the folder with the same name.
