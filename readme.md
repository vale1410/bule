Bule helps you to create beautiful CNF & QBF encodings.
The program `bule` is a sophisticated grounder for the modelling language Bule that translates to CNF for SAT Solving. 

## Features

* Grounding with the declarative modelling language Bule
* satisfiability solving - allowing any number of SAT solvers to be called with the grounded CNF formula
* debugging facilities for CNF formulas, statistics on size and quality 
* QBF solving
* Various encodings for cardinality constraints and Pseudo Boolean constaints. 
* Multiple cardinality encodings
