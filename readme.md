Bule helps you to create beautiful CNF and QBF encodings.
The program `bule` is a sophisticated grounder for the modeling language Bule that support SAT and QBF Solving. 

## Features

* Grounding with the declarative modelling language Bule
* satisfiability solving - allowing any number of SAT solvers to be called with the grounded CNF formula
* debugging facilities for CNF formulas, statistics on size and quality 
* QBF solving
* Various encodings for cardinality constraints and Pseudo Boolean constaints. 
* Multiple cardinality encodings

## Tutorial 

An introduction to the language can be found in this [tutorial](doc/tutorial) encoding graph coloring to SAT.
